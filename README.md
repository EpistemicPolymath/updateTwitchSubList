# About updateTwitchSubList

This is a very simple script that takes the file subscriber-list.csv which you can download from Twitch Analytics and adds all of the usernames to a txt file separated by a space. 




## .env File Setup

Add a .env file with the following values to add the file locations so that you can easily change these whenever if necessary.

``` .env
subListCSV:VALUE
subListTXT:VALUE

```
